##**Battleship: Human vs. Computer**

####*Description:*
  
  A recreation of the popular board game Battleship, executable in the terminal! In this game, you will take the role as a human trying to beat the enemy team by strategically firing missiles at specific coordinates. But be careful, you must place your ships in logical locations as well so the enemy team doesn't hit you. The enemy team can either be illogical, or logical, depending on what you prefer. The illogical AI will use the great ol' method of randomness to hunt down your ships. Meanwhile, the logical ship will use strategic moves, such as a checkboard configuration to defeat you efficiently. It is the game of a human, versus a computer. 
  
####*Instructions:*
  1) Compile Woo.java
